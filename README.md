# DotNetDataAccess
DotNetDataAccess is a solution where we can use different types of database (SQL and NoSql) and tool for CRUD operation.
Currently we have Ado.Net and Dapper for MS SQL Server and MongoDb.Driver for Mongodb.

This is an example that how we can use those databases into our C# application and what are the minimum requirements.
